<h1 align="center">Pipex: Fork This, Pipe That!</h1>

For this project, I had to understand many new concepts:

- Everything is a file, even a pipe.
- A fork: its creation, how it works, how it ends, and the fact that it runs at the same time as its parent process.
- A pipe: how to enable communication between two processes.
